PROBLEM 1 `dirops.c'
====================

A
~

  Examine the source code of `dirops.c' closely. It makes use of a
  variety of system calls to produce a semi-interesting effect.  Compile
  and run it several times. Describe the overall intent of the program
  based on its output and the code you understand.

  What set of system calls is used by the program to determine all the
  files in the current directory? Describe briefly how these calls work
  together.
  |   Uses opendir() function on current directory to access the directory.
  |   After this, it iterates through the directory's files using readdir(dir)
  |   which returns struct with properties such as the file's name.


C
~

  Identify the system call that `dirops.c' uses to find the sizes of
  files. Describe briefly how this call works.
  |   Utilizes st_size property of the of the file's stats returned
  |   by stat() call. This stat call returns statistics on the file,
  |   and one of those statistics is its size.

  The following line sets up the read/write permissions that the copied
  file will have.
  ,----
  | mode_t perms = S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR | S_IRGRP;
  `----
  Modify this line so that the copied file is readable by the group as
  well as the user.

  /Optional challenge:/ Set the permissions to be identical to the
  original file. `stat()' is one way to find out the permissions for the
  original file.


E

  `dirops.c' contains a subtle bug in the following bit of code towards
  the end of the file.
  ,----
  |   while( (nbytes = read(infd, buf, BUFSIZE)) > 0){
  |     write(outfd, buf, BUFSIZE);
  |   }
  `----
  You should observe that every time program is run, it will identify a
  copied file as the largest and make another copy due to this bug. It
  may help to examine the ends of the copied files with the `tail
  file.txt.copy' command which will show the last 10 lines.

	|   while( (nbytes = read(infd, buf, BUFSIZE)) > 0){
  	|     write(outfd, buf, nbytes);
  	|   }

  	The loop just wrote BUFSIZE bytes every time instead of the number of bytes read so there would be chunks of trailing empty bytes.
